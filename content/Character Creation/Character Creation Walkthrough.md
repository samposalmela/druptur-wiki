WORK IN PROGRESS

When creating a character consider the following: **Used rule variations:**

- D&D 2024 rules (with Legacy content available for use),
- Level 1,
- Advancement Type: XP,
- Hit Point Type: Fixed,
- Ability Scores: Point Buy,
- Equipment: Starting Equipment (Class, Background),

**You are free to:**

- Modify your starting equipment within the same category ex. Changing Longsword for a Glaive,
- Have some items that have no gameplay usage but are important to your backstory ex. Cool looking sword or a letter from the king.,

If you have **additional questions** about your character, you are free to comment them here or **contact your DM directly.**

When you have completed your character, make sure to **inform your DM about anything important that can't be told to others.** Otherwise you can post it to ⁠adventurers .
