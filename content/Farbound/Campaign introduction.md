They called it the Far Continent—a vast land whispered of in old sailor's charts and half-mad explorer journals. No empire had claimed it, no scholar had mapped it, and no soul who went searching ever returned. Until now. 

You were among dozens of adventurers aboard the great vessel Farfinder, sent to survey this mysterious land, to discover its secrets, and to forge a future in its shadowed wilds. But something went wrong. The skies tore open. The sea screamed. The ship was lost. 

And yet… you live.

Awakening within the shattered remains of the ship, preserved by ancient magic and the will of something else—a presence born from the dying heartbeat of the Farfinder—you find yourself far from any known shore. The ship's spirit, now awakened, watches over the ruin like a slumbering sentinel, shielding the wreck as your only safe haven.

There is no way back. Only forward.

The wilds are calling. The mystery deepens. And survival begins now.

Welcome to Farbound.
