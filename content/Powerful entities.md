# Divine Beings

Gods and other high beings influence everything that happens across Druptur—from the storms at sea to the miracle of life. The hierarchy of gods consists of the **Helm**, the most powerful gods in Druptur who are worshipped globally and recognized by all, and the **Sails**, lesser deities who are either worshipped locally or have gained power through other means.

A deity's power can be influenced by many factors: the number of their worshippers, the concept or element they represent, or even their personal accomplishments.

Deities are able to contact mortals through visions, natural phenomena, or even divine messengers.

# Devils

The devils of Druptur are fueled by fear. The more something is feared across the land, the stronger the devil associated with that fear becomes. Conversely, it is likely that there is a devil for everything, since everything is feared by someone.

Devils are often in contact with mortals through pacts and possessions. It is said that the greater the fear tied to a devil’s domain, the stronger the pact.

## Some Named Devils

- Devil of Spiders
- Devil of Loneliness
- Devil of Drowning

# Legendary Mortals

## Tir Halla

Emperor of the [[Major locations#Halla|Halla Empire]]. Said to be the most powerful warrior in all of Druptur, he is both respected and feared by many.

Few have ever seen his face, and nobody even knows his true age. It is rumored he is human, but this remains speculation. In battle, he is clad entirely in brass armor. Even when addressing his subjects from a stage, he wears his emperor’s helmet.

He was said to ride at the front lines during the Empire's greatest conquests, and many believe that Halla still stands today thanks to his unmatched leadership. Nobody knows why he started his conquest to expand the Empire, but he seems satisfied with his current status—though the newly found Far Continent has piqued his interest.

## Eldun Clanhand

A human adventurer immortalized in many ballads sung by bards across the main continent. He is said to have slain monsters and dragons that terrorized the land. He was a respected member of a party led by him since his youth. Now in his elder and wiser days, he has set his sights on continuing his adventures as the leader of Farport on the Far Continent.
