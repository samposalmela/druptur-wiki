## New to Dungeons and Dragons?

> Dungeons & Dragons is a tabletop roleplaying game where you take on the role of a character in a shared fantasy world.

Most important for you is to make yourself at least familiar with the concept of the game, but if you are here that means your probably already know something. You can use the [Basic Rules](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/) that are free to everyone, for gaining deeper knowledge before hopping into the game. Internet is also full of sources and material to dive into. 

Don't be afraid to contact your Dungeon Master through Discord to get more information and to ask question!
